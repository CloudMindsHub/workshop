# Fine-tuning Amazon Nova models on AWS Bedrock

### Overview
In recent years, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** has emerged as a powerful tool, widely applied across various fields such as healthcare, education, business, and technology. However, for AI to truly **understand** and **effectively solve** a specific problem, we often need to "**retrain**" it using our own data. This process is called **fine-tuning**.

Simply put, fine-tuning is a method that helps a pre-trained AI model become more suited to the specific needs and data of an individual or organization. Instead of building a model from scratch — which can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive — fine-tuning allows us to leverage existing capabilities and adjust them to make the AI work more efficiently in real-world scenarios. This is a crucial step in bringing AI into real applications that align closely with everyday usage needs.

### Architecture

The **fine-tuning** process of an AI model typically goes through the following steps:
