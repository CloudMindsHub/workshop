# Customizing Amazon Nova models

### Overview
As AI and Machine Learning continue to evolve, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has become essential for optimizing performance to meet specific needs. Our project focuses on customizing **Amazon Nova** models through **fine-tuning** techniques to enhance accuracy and relevance for real-world applications.

**Amazon Nova** is an advanced AI model developed by AWS, providing powerful natural language processing capabilities. It can be fine-tuned to fit enterprise applications, chatbots, text analysis, and various other AI use cases. By leveraging fine-tuning, we can adjust **Nova** to our project's specific dataset, improving accuracy and response quality for specialized queries.

In the following sections, we will detail the **fine-tuning** process, the technologies used, and the technical challenges encountered during the implementation of our project.
