### Overview of the Dataset

- This dataset is an extension of the Viet-Doc VQA project, constructed from **64,765 pages of Vietnamese educational documents** 🇻🇳, including workbooks, specialized books, and lesson plans from official publishers such as the **Ministry of Education & Training**, **Cánh Diều**, **Chân Trời Sáng Tạo**, **Kết Nối Tri Thức**, and others, covering **all subjects from grades 1 to 12**.

- Each document page has been carefully annotated using **Visual Question Answering (VQA)** techniques, resulting in a high-quality and information-rich dataset.

- The dataset contains **388,277 contextual question-answer pairs** with detailed descriptions, automatically generated by **Gemini 1.5 Flash** – Google’s state-of-the-art AI model, which is currently leading the **WildVision Arena** leaderboard. This makes the dataset an ideal resource for modern educational research and applications.

- Subjects covered include: **Mathematics 📐, Literature 📚, English 🇬🇧, Physics ⚛️, Chemistry 🧪, Biology 🌱, History 📜, Geography 🌍, Civic Education 🏫, Computer Science 💻, Technology 🛠️, Music 🎵, Art 🎨, Physical Education ⚽**, and more.

Due to budget constraints, and for the purpose of **experimenting with fine-tuning on AWS Bedrock**, this workshop only uses a sample of **100 data points**, which is the **minimum required to run fine-tuning on Bedrock**.
